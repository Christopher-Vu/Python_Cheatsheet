# Python_Cheatsheet
## BRIEF HISTORY
A collection of everything I have learned in python; was keeping it in pycharm but decided to move it to Github as well. <br >
Going to commit to this whenever I learn anything.

## IF YOU PLAN TO RUN IT
Don't. This was made to reference for syntax, not to see the results of that code (and most directories and pathing was made specifically for how files are organized on my computer).
