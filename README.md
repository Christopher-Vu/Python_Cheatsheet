# Python_Cheatsheet
## BRIEF HISTORY
A collection of everything I have learned in python; was keeping it in pycharm but decided to move it to Github as well. <br >
Gonna commit to this whenever I learn anything.

## IF YOU PLAN TO RUN IT
This cheatsheet is mostly syntax; note that if you run this cheatsheet will could potentially throw an error because all files are based on directories from my computer. I you want to run it, you will have to copy the whole git (not just the CheatSheet.py file). You also will need to download stack overflow's 2021 survey (it is used for a section on pandas) and save the 2 csv files as "stack_overflow_2021_survey_data" and "stack_overflow_2021_survey_results" in the "CheatSheet_FileIO" folder. You will also need a csv on ethereum prices (here : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/master/Python/Pandas/10-Datetime-Timeseries/ETH_1h.csv), which is also for the pandas section.
